# Project 2: Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, I will work with the Bank Marketing dataset. I will use the Azure to cinfigure a cloud-based machine learning model, deploy and consume it. I will also publish and consume a pipeline. This project will highlight the skills I have learned:
- AutoML
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline
